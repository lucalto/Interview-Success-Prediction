# Interview-Success-Prediction
Given a dataset on resumes, this project tries to predict whether a candidate will pass their interview based on their resume.
We will use the following models to make the prediction:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction.
